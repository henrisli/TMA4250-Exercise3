# Problem 1: Markov RF

This problem is based on observations of seismic data over a domain $\mathcal{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$. The objective is to identify the underlying {sand, shale} lithology distribution over $\mathcal{D}$, represented by $\{0, 1\}$ respectively. 

The observations are collected on a regular $(75 \times 75)$ grid $L_D$, and the seismic data are denoted $\{d(\mathbf{x}); \mathbf{x} \in L_D\};d(\mathbf{x})\in \mathbb{R}$, represented by the $n$-vector $\mathbf{d}$. We retrieve the observations from the R library MASS in the file _seismic.dat_. 

Moreover, observations of the lithology distribution {sand, shale} in a geologically comparable domain $\mathcal{D}_c \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is available. THe lithology distribution is collected on a regular $(50\times 50)$ grid $L_{D_c}$, which has the same spacing as $L_D$ over $\mathcal{D}_c$. Here, we retrieve the observations from the same R library MASS in the file _complit.dat_.

We assume that the underlying lithology distribution can be represented by a Mosaic RF $\{l(\mathbf{x});\mathbf{x}\in L_D\};l(\mathbf{x})\in\{0,1\}$ represented by the $n$-vector $\mathbf{l}$.
